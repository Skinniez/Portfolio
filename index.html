		  <h4> Career and Education </h4> <!-- about me article -->
        <p>As a medical records professional I gained a deeper understanding of data entry and the value of an organized workflow,<br> and as a kitchen worker I gained a strong respect for the importance of teamwork. <br>
		I have always been fascinated with a career in a tech field and there is no time like the present to make a change!</p>

        <p>I have been studying computer science at a traditional university until my good friend talked to me about bootcamps, <br> and how it helped her get the knowledge she needed for the exact career she wanted. </p>

        <p>Now I am a student at Thinkful and starting my journey of software engineering and I am excited to be making the change.</p>
