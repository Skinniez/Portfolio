<p> My name is Jesse Strickland. After years of fighting and sweating in the food service industry I am excited to be making steps to a career change. A career change to software engineering was always in the back of my mind, but I always stuck with what I knew which has always been cooking or serving.</p>
<p>My thought process for a career change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm tired of working 12 hour days</li>
  <li>There's no upward movement in service</li>
  <li>Very little respect from customers and bosses</li>
</ul>
